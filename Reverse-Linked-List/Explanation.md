## Reverse Linked List Solution
### Approach
- Used **iterative pointer manipulation** to reverse links in-place.
- Time Complexity: O(n), Space Complexity: O(1).

### Relevance to MSc
Aligns with *Algorithmen und Datenstrukturen* by teaching pointer manipulation and memory optimization.

### Edge Cases
- Handles empty lists.
- Works for single-node lists.
