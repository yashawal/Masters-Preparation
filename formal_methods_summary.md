# Formal Methods in Security  
**Büchi Automata**:  
- Used to model infinite behaviors (e.g., repeated login attempts).  
- Example: Authentication protocol states and transitions.  

**LTL Properties**:  
- `G(φ)`: Globally/Always φ.  
- `F(φ)`: Eventually φ.  
- Applied to verify: "A failed login eventually triggers an alert."
